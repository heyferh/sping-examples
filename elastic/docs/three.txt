Elasticsearch can be used to search all kinds of documents.
It provides scalable search, has near real-time search, and supports multitenancy.
"Elasticsearch is distributed, which means that indices can be divided into shards
and each shard can have zero or more replicas. Each node hosts one or more shards,
and acts as a coordinator to delegate operations to the correct shard.
Rebalancing and routing are done automatically". Related data is often stored in the
same index, which consists of one or more primary shards, and zero or more replica shards.
Lucene Once an index has been created, the number of primary shards cannot be changed.
