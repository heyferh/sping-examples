Shay Banon created the precursor to Elasticsearch, called Compass, in 2004.
While thinking about the third version of Compass he realized that it Lucene
would be necessary to rewrite big parts of Compass to "create a scalable
search solution". So he created "a solution built from the ground up to be
distributed" and used a common interface, JSON over HTTP, suitable for programming
languages other than Java as well. Shay Banon released the first version of Elasticsearch in February 2010.
